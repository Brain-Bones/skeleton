Workflow
------------------

Avoid commits and PRs without prior discussion. Open-source is most successful when we all work together.

1.  [Select an issue](https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton/issues) or [roadmap task](https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton/wiki/%F0%9F%9B%A3%EF%B8%8F-The-Skeleton-Roadmap-(proposal)) you want to contribute to.
2.  Leave a comment, join the [roadmap discussion](https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton/discussions/79), or notify other contributors on Discord.
3.  Review with other contributors to define the requirements before you begin. (This is critical!)
4.  Create a feature branch against the `dev` branch using the branch naming convention of prepending `docs/`, `feat/`, `chore/`, `bugfix/`, or `tests/` to the branch name.
5.  Make your changes, then run automated tests to ensure no regressions were introduced.
6.  When ready, submit a pull request to begin the code review process.
7.  If your PR meets all requirements, it will be merged!

The overwhelming majority of rejected pull requests come from submissions without prior discussion and submissions that do not meet the requirements for a feature or otherwise conflict with ongoing efforts. To avoid rejection, be a team player, don't try to be a hero!

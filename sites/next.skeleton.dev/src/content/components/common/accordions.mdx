### Multiple Items

Enable the `multiple` setting to enable displaying more than one accordion panel at a time.

```html
<Accordion multiple>...</Accordion>
```

### Open State

Set the visible items on load with `open`. When using `multiple` mode, this enables multiple items.

```html
<AccordionItem open>...</AccordionItem>
```

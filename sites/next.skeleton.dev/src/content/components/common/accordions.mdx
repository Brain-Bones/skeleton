### Auto-Collapse

Enable the `autocollapse` setting to limit display to one accordion panel at a time.

```html
<Accordion autocollapse>...</Accordion>
```

### Open State

Set the visible items on load with `open`. When using `autocollapse` mode, this is limited to a single item.

```html
<AccordionItem open>...</AccordionItem>
```

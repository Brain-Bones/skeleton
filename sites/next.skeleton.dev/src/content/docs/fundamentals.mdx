<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton is comprised of three modular pillars. Together, these form a complete top-to-bottom solution to aid in designing and implementing frontend interfaces for your web-based applications.</p>

---

## Design System

### Figma UI Kit

Skeleton provides a powerful Figma UI Kit to assist your designers to create a visual concept of your project.

### Core Concepts

Select a section below to learn more about Skeleton's core design systems. These features integrate directly with the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

<NavGrid collection="design" path="" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

---

## Tailwind

Skeleton provides a number of Tailwind componments that act as primitives for building more complex interfaces. These are made available by the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

<NavGrid collection="tailwind" path="" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

---

## Components

An extensive library of components are avilable that provide turnkey support for Skeleton's design system. Including built in support for Skeleton's Tailwind utility classes, and the full theme system.

### Supported Frameworks

Skeleton provides turnkey components for the follow UI frameworks.

| Framework | Skeleton NPM Package            | Description                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| React     | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react`  | Contains all features purpose-built for React.  |
| Svelte    | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | Contains all features purpose-built for Svelte. |

### Adding a Component

Import the component you wish to use fom your framework package of choice.

```ts
import { Avatar } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}';
```

Implement the component into to your page.

```ts
<Avatar />
```

### Component Props

Skeleton designates several common categories of props for each component.

- **Functional Props** - directly affect the functionality of the component, such as an `open` or `active` boolean state.
- **Style Props** - contain and accept Tailwind utility classes to affect the style, such as `background` for setting a background color.
- **Event Props** - accept callback functions, such as `onclick`, `onkeypress`, and more.

For our Avatar component we can set both `src` and `alt` components.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} alt="janedoe" />
```

### Style Props

Skeleton components are styled by default when using the Skeleton Tailwind Plugin in your project. However, if you wish to customize a component, we provide a number of style-focused properties that accept Tailwind utility classes to customize the look and feel. Style props fall into one of three categories:

- `base` - provides the general structure and styling for the template element within the component.
- `{property}` - take individual utility classes to customize the look, such as `background`, `padding`, or `margin`.
- `classes` - allows you to pass an arbitrary set of utility classes to go beyond the defaults.

Property styles are the most common. We use can a `background` style prop to affect the Avatar's background color:

```ts
<Avatar background="bg-red-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

We can use `classes` to extend and add new additional styles that don't exist by default.

```ts
<Avatar classes="border-4 border-green-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

Finally, we can use `base` to clear out the base styles for the component and implement our own. This will completely replace the default base styles for this component.

```ts
<Avatar base="overflow-visible">Sk</Avatar>
```

### Going Further

If you need to reach deeper into the component template, consult the component documentation and API. Prefixed style classes are available to handle these scenarios, such as `imageBase` and `imageClasses`. This would affect only the Avatar's `<img>` tag and use Tailwind's `grayscale` class to force the image to image black and white.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

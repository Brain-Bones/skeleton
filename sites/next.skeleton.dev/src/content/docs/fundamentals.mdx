<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton is comprised of three modular pillars - the design system, Tailwind utilies, and components. These form a complete solution for designing and implementing interfaces within your application.</p>

---

## Design System

### Figma UI Kit

Skeleton provides a powerful [Figma UI Kit](/docs/figma) to assist your designers in drafting a visual concept of your project.

### Core Concepts

Learn more about Skeleton's functional design systems, provided by the Skeleton Tailwind plugin and theme system.

## Tailwind

Tailwind components that act as primitives for complex interfaces. Provided courtesy of the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

<NavGrid collection="tailwind" path="" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

## Components

Skeleton provides optional component packages for several popular UI frameworks. These provide support for complex and functional features, while supporting Skeleton's design system out of the box.

### Supported Frameworks

| Framework | NPM Package                     | Description                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| React     | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react`  | Contains all components and features for React.  |
| Svelte    | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | Contains all components and features for Svelte. |

### Adding a Component

Import the component you wish to use fom your framework package of choice.

```ts
import { Avatar } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}';
```

Then insert the component reference in your project pages.

```ts
<Avatar />
```

### Component Props

Skeleton component properties fall into several categories.

- **Functional Props** - directly affect the functionality of the component, such as an `open` or `active`.
- **Style Props** - accept Tailwind utility classes that affect styling, such as `background` for background color.
- **Event Props** - accept callback functions for interaction, such as `onclick`, `onkeypress`, and more.

For our Avatar component we can set both `src` and `alt` components.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} alt="janedoe" />
```

### Style Props

By default most Skeleton components come with a set of default styles out of the box. However, if you wish to customize the look and feel, then you may do so using Style Props. These fall into a few categories.

- `base` - provides the general structure and styling for the element within the component's template.
- `{property}` - take individual utility classes to customize styling, such as `background`, `padding`, or `margin`.
- `classes` - allows you to pass any arbitrary utility classes to extend the class list.

Property styles are the most common. We use can a `background` style prop to affect the Avatar's background color:

```ts
<Avatar background="bg-red-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

We can use `classes` to extend and add new additional styles not available by default.

```ts
<Avatar classes="border-4 border-green-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

Finally, we can use `base` to reset and add our own styles from the ground up. This provides a faux-headless approach.

```ts
<Avatar base="overflow-visible">Sk</Avatar>
```

If you need to reach deeper into the component template, consult each component's API. Most components offer prefixed style classes to affect nested elements, such as `imageBase` and `imageClasses`.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

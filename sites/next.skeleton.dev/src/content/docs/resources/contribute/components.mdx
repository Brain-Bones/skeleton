## Packages

Framework packages are found within the Skeleton monorepo in the following locations.

| Package                     | Framework                       | App Framework                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte` | [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) | [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) |
| `/packages/skeleton-react`  | [React](https://react.dev/)     | [Vite/React](https://vitejs.dev/)    |

The purpose of our component packages is two-fold. First, they house and export the full set of components available to that framework. Additionally, each project contains a dedicated app framework. This is used to test the components in their native environment. Use these projects as a sandbox to test and iterate before adding the components to the public facing Astro-base documentation website.

### Dev Server

To run each app framework, change your directory to the respective package and run the following command.

```shell
cd packages/skeleton-svelte
pnpm run dev
```

### Server Ports

The following represents the _default_ localhost address and port for each project. This will be displayed in the terminal when starting each dev server.

- Documentation Site: `http://localhost:4321/`
- Svelte Package App: `http://localhost:5173/`
- React Package App: `http://localhost:5173/`

You may run the documentation site and framework packages in parallel at the same time. If the server shares a port, this will increment by one for the next server (ex: `5174`, `5175`, etc). Keep your eye on the terminal to retrieve the specific local address.

## Add Components

Components are housed in the following location per framework:

| Framework | Directory             |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Svelte    | `/src/lib/components` |
| React     | `/src/components`     |

Use the following file path conventions when creating a new component:

```
/components
    /ComponentName
        ComponentName.{svelte|tsx|...}
        types.ts
```

## Props

Skeleton designates the following categories of component properties. These should be maintained in the following order.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
let {
	// Functional
	open: false,
	// Style
	base: '...',
	bg: '...',
	classes: '...',
	// Event
	onclick: () => {},
	// Children
	snippetExample
	children
} = $props<ExampleProps>();
```

- **Functional** - these should be single instance props that directly affect the functionality of the component.
- **Style** - contain and accept Tailwind utility classes to affect the style of the component.
- **Event** - provide callback functions for external event handlers.
- **Children** - contain reference to React children, Svelte Snippets, or similar.

### Style Prop Conventions

Style props implement sementic naming conventions to enable specificity and avoid naming conflicts. These are organized into three specific categories. Each should be maintained in the following order.

- `base` - houses the base utility classes, which enables faux-headless styling.
  - Replaces: `cBase` class definitions from Skeleton v2.
  - Parent base props are not prefixed, which helps maintain parity cross-framework
  - Child base props are prefixed: `titleBase`, `panelBase`, `controlBase`.
- `{property}` - individual style props that houses one or more “swappable” utility classes.
  - Naming should follow Tailwind convention, except for single letter descriptors (ex: use `padding` instead of `p`).
  - Parent props are not prefixed: `background`, `margin`, `border`.
  - Child props are prefixed: `titleBg`, `controlMargin`, `panelBorder`.
- `classes` - allows you to extend or override the class list with an arbitrary set of utility classes.
  - Replaces the inconsistent use of `slotX` and `regionX` classes in Skeleton v2.
  - Uses `classes` (plural) to avoid conflict with the standard `class` attribute.
    - Parent instances are not prefixed: `classes`
    - Child instances are prefixed: `titleClasses`, `controlClasses`, `panelClasses`

Here's what this might look like in practice.

```ts
let {
	// Parent
	base: '...',
	bg: '...',
	classes: '...',
	// Child
	controlBase: '...',
	controlBg: '...',
	controlClasses: '...',
	// Child (or Grandchild)
	panelBase: '...',
	panelBg: '...',
	panelPadding: '...',
	panelClasses: '...',
} = $props<ExampleProps>();
```

```html
<!-- Parent -->
<div class="{base} {bg} {classes}">
	<!-- Child: Control -->
	<div class="{controlBase} {controlBg} {controlClasses}">...</div>
	<!-- Child: Panel -->
	<div class="{panelBase} {panelBg} {panelPadding} {panelClasses}">...</div>
</div>
```

### Dynamic Style Props

You may need to conditionally update or swap between one or more sets of style prop classes. For this, we will use an “interceptor” pattern as demonstrated below. The `rx` naming convention denotes that the value will be derived in a reactive manner. This is simpler to distinguish in the template from standard style prop classes.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let {
		active = true,
		// ...
		fooActive = '...',
		fooInactive = '...'
		// ...
	} = $props<ExampleProps>();

	// Interceptor
	const rxActive = $derived(active ? fooActive : fooInactive);
</script>

<div class="{base} {rxActive} {classes}">...</div>
```

> TIP: use this convention in React as well, but make use of a ternary, `useState`, or `useMemo` hooks as appropriate.

## Type Definitions

All component props should be strongly typed using Typescript in a colocated `types.ts` file. Each prop should be described using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started). This provides additional context through Intellisense features of text editors and IDEs and helps generate automatic documentation for these features. Remember to keep the description short and semantic.

```ts
export interface AccordionItemProps {
	/** Sets the open state of the item. */
	open?: boolean;

	// Parent ---
	/** Set the parent base styles. */
	base?: string;
	/** Set the parent background styles. */
	background?: string;
	/** Provide the parent a set of arbitrary classes. */
	classes?: string;

	// Lead ---
	/** Sets the lead snippet element's base styles. */
	leadBase?: string;
	/** Sets the lead snippet element's padding styles. */
	leadPadding?: string;
	/** Provide arbitrary CSS classes to the lead snippet. */
	leadClasses?: string;

	// Children ---
	/** The default slot contents within the component. */
	children?: Snippet;
}
```

## Context API

### Svelte

Skeleton expands the [Svelte Context API](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte#setcontext) via a utility called `createContext`, which handles the following:

- Generates a unique key using the [`Symbol` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).
- Ensure type safety when getting and setting context.
- Allows for a fallback when there is no context provided.

Here's an example of how this can be used:

```ts
import { createContext } from '$lib/internal/create-context.js';

interface Session {
	user: 'foo' | 'bar';
}

export const [setSession, getSession] = createContext<Session>({ user: 'foo' });
```

Which can then be used like so:

```ts
import { setSession, getSession } from './context.js';

// Must be set as type of Session:
setSession({ user: 'bar' });

// Returns as type of Session:
const session = getSession();
```

## Generating Schema

> NOTE: currently limited to the `skeleton-react` package only!

When adding or editing a `types.ts` file, you'll be required to generate or update component type schema. This is useful for populating the API Reference per each component page. Make sure to follow these steps:

1. When a `types.ts` files has been added or edited, run `pnpm schema` to generate `schema.json` files.
2. Then, make sure each `schema.json` file is exported within the package `index.js` list.
3. Finally, within each component page, import the schema data, then pass this to a `ApiTable` component.

```ts
import { AccordionSchema } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react/schemas';
```

```tsx
<ApiTable schema={AccordionSchema} types={['AccordionProps', 'AccordionItemProps', '...']} />
```

This will generate a styled table detailing type data for each type supplied.

## Animations

Skeleton opts for what we feel is the most optimal solution for animations per framework. This means implementation and capabilities may differ slightly for each. Please refer to the [Accordion](/docs/components/accordion/react) component source code for a reference example.

| Package                     | Solution                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte` | [Svelte Transition](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-transition) |
| `/packages/skeleton-react`  | [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)                |

## Composed Pattern

To keep component syntax consistent cross-framework, we implement a composed pattern. Components are composed using a set of smaller components, named slots, or snippets - depending on the framework. This implementation differs per framework.

### React

For React, this is handled via small components that implement the dot notation syntax.

```tsx
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item>
		<Accordion.Control>(control)</Accordion.Control>
		<Accordion.Panel>(panel)</Accordion.Panel>
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Svelte

This is handled by pairing child components with [Svelte Snippets](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/snippets).

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item>
		{#snippet controlLead()}(lead){/snippet}
		{#snippet control()}(control){/snippet}
		{#snippet panel()}(panel){/snippet}
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Dot Notation Syntax

The implementation of this will differ per framework.

### React

To implement this, we use `Object.assign()`

```ts
Object.assign(RootComponent, { children });
```

For example, for the accordion component

```ts
export const Accordion = Object.assign(
	AccordionRoot, // -> <Accordion>
	{
		Item: AccordionItem, // -> <Accordion.Item>
		Control: AccordionControl, // -> <Accordion.Control>
		Panel: AccordionPanel // -> <Accordion.Panel>
	}
);
```

### Svelte

Create a new `index.ts` file colocated within the `/component/<ComponentName>` directory:

```ts
import Tabs from './Tabs.svelte';
import TabsControl as Control from './TabsControl.svelte';

export default Object.assign(Tabs, {Control});
```

## Component Exports

Finally, make sure components are included in the package export list.

### React

Found in `/src/lib/index.ts`.

```ts
export { Foo } from '../components/Foo/Foo.jsx';
export { Bar } from '../components/Bar/Bar.jsx';
```

### Svelte

Found in `/src/components/index.ts`.

```ts
export { default as Foo } from './components/Foo';
export { default as Bar } from './components/Bar';
```

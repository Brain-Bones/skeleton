## Work in Progress

We're currently implementing the [next major version](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/discussions/2375) of Skeleton. In the meantime, check our [v2 doc site](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/introduction) for more information. This website currently exists as an early preview, and we hope to share more very soon.

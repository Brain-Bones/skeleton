## Why Skeleton

### Design System

At its core, a design system is a set of building blocks that standarizes the look and feel of your products and user experiences. This offers uniform language and a structured framework to support you and your team. A good design system can greatly reduce the amount of time spent recreating elements and redefining patterns while building products and user interfaces at scale.

### Figma UI Kit

Skeleton provides access to a powerful [Figma UI Kit](/docs/figma) to assist designers in drafting a visual concept of your upcoming projects.

### Tailwind++

Skeleton fully embraces [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and its powerful utility-based approach to styling, built around the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), while also extending the capabilities in really meaningful ways, including not only themes but comprehensive systems for colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Theme System

Skeleton provides best in class support for themes and styling, including a full set of fully curated themes built-in, as well as a powerful but easy to use [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/) for creating new themes that fully adhere to your unique branding and design.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's best features are fully framework agnostic, requiring only a single dependency - Tailwind. This provides the full design system, themes, and more for nearly any web-based application.

### Components

Skeleton also provides a suite of powerful UI components that full adapt to your theme stytem, providing complex functionality and handling local state management. We currently provide support for React and Svelte, with plans to expand to all popular UI frameworks in the future.

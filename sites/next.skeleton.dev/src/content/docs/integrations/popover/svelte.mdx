## Floating UI Svelte

<div class="card preset-outlined-warning-500 p-8 space-y-8">
	<p class="type-scale-5">Coming soon! [Floating UI Svelte](https://floating-ui-svelte.vercel.app/) is an upcoming open-source library in development by [members of Skeleton](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/floating-ui-svelte/discussions/50). Once available, we expect this to become the defacto solution for may Svelte users, even outside of Skeleton. For now, Skeleton provides several Svelte components as substitutions. These are more limited in scope, but still applicable for most use cases. These components will remain until Floating UI Svelte is ready for production, at which point each component will be become deprecated and slated for removal in the next major release (Skeleton 4.x).</p>

## Native Browser APIs

Skeleton aims to support native-first whenever possible. Our long term goal is to help everyone transition from dedicated libraries like Floating UI to the following native browser APIs. Unfortunately some features are not widely available in all browsers at this time. However, Skeleton will adopt these as the defacto solution at some point in the future.

* [Dialog Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)
* [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
* [CSS Anchoring Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning)

## Floating UI React

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<p class="type-scale-5">The goal of [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) is to provide the primitives required to create components for tooltips, popovers, dropdown menus, hover cards, modal dialogs, select menus, comboboxes, and more. Instead of providing any pre-built components, [Floating UI React](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react) provides a streamlined experience for creating common types of popovers. While enabling full control over how these features operate.</p>

## Integration

> NOTE: the full Floating UI React integration guide is coming soon.

## Native Browser APIs

Skeleton aims to support native-first whenever possible. Our long term goal is to help everyone transition from dedicated libraries like Floating UI to the following native browser APIs. Unfortunately some features are not widely available in all browsers at this time. However, Skeleton will adopt these as the defacto solution at some point in the future.

* [Dialog Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)
* [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
* [CSS Anchoring Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning)

## Floating UI React

<p class="type-scale-5">[Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) provides primitives for creating tooltips, popovers, dropdown menus, hover cards, modal dialogs, select menus, comboboxes, and more. Instead of providing pre-built components, this guide will introduce the fundamentals of [Floating UI React](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react). This tool provides an open-ended solution for creating popovers of any form factor, then pairing this with Skeleton's design system and components.</p>

## Learn the Basics

If this is your first time using Floating UI, start here:

* [Floating UI Tutorial](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial) - covers the basics of using native Javascript.
* [Floating UI React Tutorial](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react) - covers the basics of using the React wrapper.

### Imports

Floating UI React exposes all required Floating UI middleware, types, etc.

```ts
import { useFloating } from '@floating-ui/react';
```

### Making Elements Float

Make sure you the following [custom class](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial#making-the-tooltip-float) in your global stylesheet. This can then be easily reused for all floating elements. We'll use the following class as the convention for all Skeleton examples below.

```css
.floating {
	width: max-content;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
}
```

### Z-Index Stacking

Please be aware that Floating UI does not take an opinionated stance on [z-index stacking](https://floating-ui.com/docs/misc#z-index-stacking).

### Middlware

Make sure you're familiar with [Floating UI Middleware](https://floating-ui.com/docs/middleware), which provides modules for customizing the look and feel of popovers.

## Examples

Floating UI React provides an extensive set of [React examples](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-examples). These serve as the foundation for integrating Skeleton.

### Popover

Triggers an anchored popover when you <u>click</u> the trigger element.

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExamplePopover client:load />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		<Code code={ExamplePopoverRaw} lang="tsx" />
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Tooltip

Triggers an anchored popover when you <u>hover</u> the trigger element.

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleTooltip client:load />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		<Code code={ExampleTooltipRaw} lang="tsx" />
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Combobox

Triggers an anchored popover list on search. Includes autocomplete with automatic selection.

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleCombobox client:load />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		<Code code={ExampleComboboxRaw} lang="tsx" />
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Modal

Generates any form of modal or dialog that require a user's immediate attention.

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleModal client:load />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		<Code code={ExampleModalRaw} lang="tsx" />
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

## API Reference

| Framework | Description | |
|---|---|---|
| `useFloating` | The main Hook of the library that acts as a controller for all other Hooks and components. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useFloating) |
| `useInteractions` | A hook to merge or compose interaction event handlers together, preserving memoization. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useInteractions) |
| `useHover` | Opens the floating element while hovering over the reference element, like CSS `:hover`. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useHover) |
| `useFocus` | Opens the floating element while the reference element has focus, like CSS `:focus`. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useFocus) |
| `useClick` | Opens or closes the floating element when clicking the reference element. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useClick) |
| `useRole` | Adds base screen reader props to the reference and floating elements for a given `role`. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useRole) |
| `useDismiss` | Closes the floating element when a dismissal is requested — by default, when the user presses the `escape` key or outside of the floating element with their pointer. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useDismiss) |
| `useListNavigation` | Adds arrow key-based navigation of a list of items, either using real DOM focus or virtual focus. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useListNavigation) |
| `useTypeahead` | Provides a matching callback that can be used to focus an item as the user types, used in tandem with `useListNavigation()`. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useTypeahead) |
| `useTransition` | Provides the ability to apply CSS transitions to a floating element, including correct handling of “placement-aware” transitions. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useTransition) |
| `useClientPoint` | Positions the floating element at a given client point `(x, y)`, usually generated by a mouse event. By default, the client’s mouse position is automatically tracked. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/useClientPoint) |
| `FloatingArrow` | Renders a customizable `<svg>` pointing arrow triangle inside the floating element that gets automatically positioned. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingArrow) |
| `FloatingFocusManager` | Provides flexible modal or non-modal focus management for a floating element. Modal behavior is the default — focus is fully trapped inside the floating element while it is rendered. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingFocusManager) |
| `FloatingPortal` | Portals the floating element into a given container element — by default, outside of the app root and into the body. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingPortal) |
| `FloatingTree` | Provides context for nested floating elements when they are not children of each other on the DOM. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingTree) |
| `FloatingOverlay` | Provides base styling for a fixed overlay element. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingOverlay) |
| `FloatingList` | Provides the ability to create composable children APIs for list components | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingList) |
| `FloatingDelayGroup` | Provides context for a group of floating elements that should share a `delay` which temporarily becomes `1` ms after the first floating element of the group opens. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingDelayGroup) |
| `Composite` | Creates a single tab stop whose items are navigated by arrow keys, which provides list navigation outside of floating element contexts. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/Composite) |
| `Inner` | Positions the floating element such that an inner element inside of it is anchored to the reference element, while handling scroll and overflow behavior. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/inner) |
| `React Utils` | Merges an array of refs, returning a memoized callback `ref` or `null`. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-utils) |
| `Custom Hooks` | You can build your own custom Hook to perform unique logic that is not currently exported by the library. | [View](https://floating-ui.com/docs/custom-hooks) |

## Native Browser APIs

Skeleton will always favor native browser APIs over third-party libraries such as Floating UI React. Unfortunately not all required APIs are widely available cross-browser. However, if your audience is limited to Chromium-based browsers, you should be able to support most of these features today.

* [Dialog Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)
* [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
* [CSS Anchoring Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning)

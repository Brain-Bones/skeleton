## Floating UI React

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<p class="type-scale-5">The goal of [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) is to provide the primitives required to create components for tooltips, popovers, dropdown menus, hover cards, modal dialogs, select menus, comboboxes, and more. Instead of providing any pre-built components, [Floating UI React](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react) provides a streamlined experience for creating common types of popovers. While enabling full control over how these features operate.</p>

## Integration

> NOTE: the full Floating UI React integration guide is coming soon.

## Native Browser APIs

Skeleton will always favor native browser APIs over third-party libraries such as Floating UI React. Unfortunately not all required APIs are widely available cross-browser. However, if your audience is limited to Chromium-based browsers, you should be able to support most of these features today.

<p class="type-scale-5"> Skeleton is comprised of three pillars - the design system, Tailwind utilities, and framework-specific components.
	Together these form a comprehensive solution for designing and implementing implementing complex web interfaces at scale.</p>

---

## Design System

### Figma UI Kit

A fully featured [Figma UI Kit](/docs/get-started/figma) is available to designers, allowing them to quickly draft visual concept of your project.

### Systems

A number of helpful design systems provided courtesy of the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

## Tailwind

Tailwind components that act as primitives for constructing complex interfaces. Provided courtesy of the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

## Components

Skeleton also offers optional component packages for the follow frameworks, automatically integrating Skeleton's design system.

| Framework | NPM Package                     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| React     | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react`  | Contains all components and features for React.  |
| Svelte    | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | Contains all components and features for Svelte. |

### Powered by Zag.js

Skeleton's components utilize [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) as their foundation, which provides a collection of framework-agnostic UI component patterns to manage logic and state.

### Importing Component

Import the component you wish to use fom your framework package of choice, then insert it into your page template.

```ts
import { Avatar } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}';
```
```ts
<Avatar />
```

### Component Props

Skeleton components properties (aka "props") are loosely defined into the following categories:

- **Functional Props** - directly affect the functionality of the component, such as an `open` or `src`.
- **Style Props** - accept Tailwind utility classes to affect styling, such as `background` for background color.
- **Event Props** - callback functions that trigger upon interaction, such as `onclick`, `onkeypress`, and more.

In the example below, we set functional props for `src` and `alt`, while also including a style prop for `background`.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} alt="Jane" background="bg-red-500" />
```

### Style Props

Skeleton components are styled by default out of the box. However, if you wish to customize the look and feel, then you may do so utilizing Style Props. These fall into a few sub-categories.

- `base` - the default styles for each component template element, implemented by default.
- `{property}` - take individual utility classes to customize styling, such as `background`, `padding`, or `margin`.
- `classes` - allows you to pass any arbitrary utility classes to extend the class list.

Imagine the Avatar component template was created like this:

```html
<figure class="{base} {background} {size} {font} {border} {rounded} {shadow} {classes}">
	<img {src} alt={name} class="{imageBase} {imageClasses}" />
</figure>
```

We can use the `background` style prop to replace the background color:

```ts
<Avatar background="bg-red-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

Since the component doesn't have dedicated `border` props, we can extend our class list with `classses`:

```ts
<Avatar classes="border-4 border-green-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

And we can optionally replace the default `base` styles like so. Just remember the default `{property}` styles will remain.

```css
.my-avatar { @apply bg-green-500 rounded-full overflow-hidden; }
```
```ts
<Avatar base="my-avatar">Sk</Avatar>
```

Each child element within the template are prefixed, such as `imageBase` and `imageClasses`. Consult a component's [API reference](/docs/components/accordion/react#api-reference) for a complete list of available style props.

```ts
<Avatar ... imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

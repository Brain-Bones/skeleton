<p class="type-scale-5">
	Skeleton is comprised of three pillars - the design system, Tailwind utilities, and framework-specific components.
	Together these form a comprehensive solution for designing and implementing implementing complex web interfaces at
	scale.
</p>

## Design System

### Figma UI Kit

A fully featured [Figma UI Kit](/docs/figma) is available to designers, allowing them to quickly draft visual concept of your project.

### Design Systems

A number of helpful design systems. Provided courtesy of the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

## Tailwind

Tailwind components that act as primitives for constructing complex interfaces. Provided courtesy of the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.

<NavGrid collection="tailwind" path="" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

## Components

Optional component packages, providing direct integration of Skeleton's design system and Tailwind components.

| Framework | NPM Package                     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| React     | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react`  | Contains all components and features for React.  |
| Svelte    | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | Contains all components and features for Svelte. |

### Adding a Component

Import the component you wish to use fom your framework package of choice.

```ts
import { Avatar } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}';
```

Then insert the component reference in your project pages.

```ts
<Avatar />
```

### Component Props

Skeleton component properties fall into several categories.

-   **Functional Props** - directly affect the functionality of the component, such as an `open` or `active`.
-   **Style Props** - accept Tailwind utility classes that affect styling, such as `background` for background color.
-   **Event Props** - accept callback functions for interaction, such as `onclick`, `onkeypress`, and more.

For our Avatar component we can set both `src` and `alt` components.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} alt="janedoe" />
```

### Style Props

By default most Skeleton components come with a set of default styles out of the box. However, if you wish to customize the look and feel, then you may do so using Style Props. These fall into a few categories.

-   `base` - provides the general structure and styling for the element within the component's template.
-   `{property}` - take individual utility classes to customize styling, such as `background`, `padding`, or `margin`.
-   `classes` - allows you to pass any arbitrary utility classes to extend the class list.

Property styles are the most common. We use can a `background` style prop to affect the Avatar's background color:

```ts
<Avatar background="bg-red-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

We can use `classes` to extend and add new additional styles not available by default.

```ts
<Avatar classes="border-4 border-green-500">Sk</Avatar>
```

Finally, we can use `base` to reset and add our own styles from the ground up. This provides a faux-headless approach.

```ts
<Avatar base="overflow-visible">Sk</Avatar>
```

If you need to reach deeper into the component template, consult each component's API. Most components offer prefixed style classes to affect nested elements, such as `imageBase` and `imageClasses`.

```ts
<Avatar src={someUrl} imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

## Our Philosophy

Skeleton provides a uniform design language and structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. It serves as an opinionated design system that aims to greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly build and manage your frontend interfaces at scale.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's core features are framework agnostic, only requiring the use of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, while enabling you to standardize the design process for your framework of choice.

### Native-First

We aim to embrace the interface of the web, not replace it. This is why Skeleton defaults to native browser elements and APIs whenever possible. You can see this reflected in our implementation of buttons, form elements, and many other features. Beyond ease of use, we feel this offers a huge boost to accessibility.

### Standardized

We aim to standardize the design process, providing common conventions that are easy to learn and retain, whether you work alone or in a team environment. Covering common fixtures such as themes, colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Utility-First

Skeleton fully embraces the [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach to styling, supporting all features provided by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), while extending it's capabilities in meaningful ways. Skeleton builds on Tailwind's standardization, while still supporting the encapsulated components of the modern web.

### Opt-In by Default

Most features in Skeleton are modular and opt-in by default. Enabling interface features like buttons and typography via dedicated utility classes. This allows for a simple escape hatch when you need to draw outside the lines and generate custom interfaces.

### Adaptive

Skeleton is intended to adapt to the design and aesthetic of your project, while still providing reasonable defaults. We provide the foundation for you to build from by mixing our various primitive features or using the style props for each component. Skeleton also comes equipped with a powerful [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/) for crafting custom themes for those that are design savvy, while also providing a curated set of themes for those that are not.

### Functional Components

We prioritize native first, but there will be times where you need to go further. For this, Skeleton provides an optional suite of functional components built atop the foundation of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). These components automatically adapt to the Skeleton design system out of the box. We currently support React and Svelte, with plans to extend to additional frameworks in the near future.

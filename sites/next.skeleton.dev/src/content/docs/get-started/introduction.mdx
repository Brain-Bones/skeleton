## Our Philosophy

Skeleton provides a uniform design language and a structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. It serves as an opinionated design system that aims to greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly your frontend interface at scale.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's core features are framework agnostic, requiring only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, helping you standarize the design process for your framework of choice.

### Native-First

We aim to embrace the interface of the web, not replace it, which is why Skeleton defaults to native browser elements and APIs whenever possible. You can see this reflected in our implementation of buttons, form elements, and more. Beyond ease of use, we feel this offers the best solution for user accessibility.

### Standarized

One of our primary goals is to standarize the design process, providing common conventions that are easier to learn and retain, whether you work alone or in a team environment. Covering common fixtures such as: themes, colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Utility-First

Skeleton fully embraces the [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach to styling, supporting all features provided by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), while extending the capabilities in meaningful ways. We adore Tailwind's opinionated structure, which perfectly aligns with our process for standarization, and compliments the encapsulated components of the modern web.

### Opt-In by Default

Most features in Skeleton are modular and opt-in by default. Enabling interface features like buttons and typography via dedicated utility classes. Allowing a simple escape hatch when you need to draw outside the lines and generate custom interfaces.

### Adaptive

Skeleton is intended to adapt to the design and aesthetic of your project, while still providing reasonable defaults. We provide the foundation, which can be extended by mixing and matching primitive features or via style props per each component. Skeleton comes equipped with a powerful [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/) for crafting custom themes for the design savvy, while also providing a curated set of themes for turnkey use out out of the box.

### Functional Components

While Skeleton strives to be native first, there will be times where you need to go further. For this, Skeleton provides an optional suite of functional components built atop the foundation of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). These components full adapt to the Skeleton design system out of the box. We currently support React and Svelte, with plans to extend to additional frameworks in the near future.

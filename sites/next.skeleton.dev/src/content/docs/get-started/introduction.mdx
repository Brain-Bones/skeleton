## Our Philosophy

At the core, Skeleton provides a uniform design language and a structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. A well produced design system can greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly produce user interfaces at scale.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's core package is framework agnostic, requiring only a single dependency: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, enabling you to build and maintain your own component library for your framework of choice. While also providing an optional and opt-in suite of components for React and Svelte users.

### Native-First

We aim to embrace the interface of the web, not replace it, which is why Skeleton defaults to native browser elements and APIs whenever possible. You can see this reflected in our implementation of buttons, form elements, and (soon) popovers. Beyond the ease of use, we feel this also offers a best in class solution for accessibility.

### Design Systems

Our goal is to standarize the design process, providing common conventions that are easier to learn and retain, whether you work alone or in a team environment. Covering common fixtures such as: themes, colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Utility-First

Skeleton fully embraces [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and their [utility-first approach](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first), supporting all built-in features, while extending the capabilities in meaningful ways. We adore Tailwind's opinionated structure, which aligns with our approach to standarization. And feel this is perfect compliment to the encapsulated components of the modern web.

### Functional Components

While Skeleton strives to be native first, there will be times where you need to go a bit further. For this, Skeleton provides an optional suite of functional components, built on the foundation of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). These components fully adapt to design system out of the box. And while we currently only support React and Svelte, we hope to extend this to additional frameworks very soon.

### Opt-In by Default

Skeleton aims to provide a modular and opt-in approach top-to-bottom. Enabling interfaces features like buttons and typography via dedicated utility classes. While still allowing for a simple escape hatch when you need to draw outside the lines and generate your own custom interface elements.

### Customization

While Skeleton aims to provide reasonable defaults out of the box, we strongly encourge you to view it as a foundation. Implement your own themes and presets, use Skeleton's utlity classes as primitives to generate more complex classes, and modify functional components with our powerful style props system. But you should never feel limited to the default settings or aesthetic.

## Our Philosophy

At the core, Skeleton provides a uniform design language and a structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. A well produced design system can greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly produce user interfaces at scale.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's core package is framework agnostic, requiring only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, enabling you to build and maintain your own component library for your framework of choice.

### Native-First

We aim to embrace the interface of the web, not replace it, which is why Skeleton defaults to native browser elements and APIs whenever possible. You can see this reflected in our implementation of buttons, form elements, and more. Beyond ease of use, we feel this offers the best solution for user accessibility.

### Standardization

One of our primary goals is to standarize the design process, providing common conventions that are easier to learn and retain, whether you work alone or in a team environment. Covering common fixtures such as: themes, colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Utility-First

Skeleton fully embraces a [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach, supporting all features provided by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), while extending the capabilities in meaningful ways. We adore Tailwind's opinionated structure, which perfectly aligns with our process for standarization, and compliments to the encapsulated components of the modern web.

### Functional Components

While Skeleton strives to be native first, there will be times where you need to go a bit further. For this, Skeleton provides an optional suite of functional components built atop the foundation of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). These components full adapt to the design system out of the box. We currently support React and Svelte, but plan to extend to additional frameworks very soon.

### Opt-In by Default

Skeleton aims to provide a modular and opt-in approach from top-to-bottom. Enabling interface features like buttons and typography via dedicated utility classes. While still allowing for an escape hatch when you need to draw outside the lines and generate custom interfaces.

### Customization

Skeleton aims to adapt to the design and aesthetic of your project, providing reasonable defaults out of the box. However you should always view this as a foundation to build from. Implement your own themes and presets, mix Skeleton's utlity classes as primitives to create complex classes, and modify functional components with our powerful style props system. Skeleton comes equipped with a curated set of themes out of the box, as well as a powerful [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/) for crafting your custom theme on-demand.

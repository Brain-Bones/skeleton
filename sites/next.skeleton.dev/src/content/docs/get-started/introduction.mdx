## Why Skeleton?

At the core, Skeleton provides a uniform design language and a structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. A well produced design system can greatly reduce the amount of time spent recreating elements and redefining patterns while building products and user interfaces at scale.

### Theme System

Skeleton fully embraces [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), while extending its capabilities in really meaningful ways. Providing best in class support for themes, colors, typography, spacing, and more. Including a fully curated set of themes out of the box, as well as a powerful [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/) for creating your own unique themes on demand.

### Framework Agnostic

Skeleton's core package is framework agnostic, requiring only a single dependency - Tailwind. This gives you full access to the design system, themes, and more for nearly any web-based application.

### Components

Skeleton's components utilize [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) as their foundation, which provides a collection of framework-agnostic UI component patterns component to manage logic and state. While the interface fully adapts to your to the Skeleton design system automatically. Currently supporting React and Svelte, with additional frameworks planned for the future.

### Figma UI Kit

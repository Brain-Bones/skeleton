## Mixing UI Libraries

Skeleton's design system is great for headless component libraries, such as [Melt UI](https://www.melt-ui.com/), [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). As well as "Tailwind component" libraries such as the [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). Essentially any component system that supports Tailwind, but very specifically allows you to insert or substitute Skeleton-provided utility classes.

### Unsupported Libraries

Unfortunately Skeleton does not support integration with [Flowbite React](https://flowbite-react.com/), [Flowbite Svelte](https://flowbite-svelte.com/), or [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) at this time. Similar to Skeleton, these libraries depend on a dedicated Tailwind plugin that directly overlaps with many of our core features, such as class names and color values.

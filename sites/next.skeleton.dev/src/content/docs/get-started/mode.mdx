## Fundamentals

Skeleton supports [Tailwind's dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) feature. This is available using either strategy below.

-   `selector` - add or remove a `.dark` class to your document's `<html>` element to determine light or dark mode.
-   `media` - uses the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) CSS media feature to determine light or dark mode.

## Styling Elements

Elements are styled using a combination of a base style (for light mode) as well as a `dark:` variant (for dark mode).

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">...</div>
```

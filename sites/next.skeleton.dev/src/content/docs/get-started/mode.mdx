## Fundamentals

Skeleton implements [Tailwind's dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) mechanics. This is available via the following strategies:

- `selector` - add or remove a `.dark` class to your document's `<html>` element to determine the mode.
- `media` - uses the CSS's [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to set the mode based on operating system preference.

## Styling Elements

The base value represents light mode, while the `dark:` modifier overrides this value for dark mode. Note that all Skeleton components implement this technique out of the box.


```html
<!--
Light Mode: White Background
Dark Mode: Black Background
-->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">...</div>
```

## Toggling Dark Mode

### Selector Strategy

See [Tailwind's recommendations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) for toggling dark mode here. Exact instructions may differ based on your application framework.

### Media Strategy

You may toggle the light or dark mode setting within your operating system system settings. This may require a browser refresh.

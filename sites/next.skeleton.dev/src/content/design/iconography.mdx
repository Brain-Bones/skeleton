## Lucide

Skeleton recommends and favors [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), a popular solution for most modern UI frameworks. You'll find Lucide used within all code examples within this documentation website. If you do not wish to use Lucide, simply replace this with the solution of your choice.

### Lucide React

[Install Lucide for React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react)

```tsx
import { Camera } from 'lucide-react';

const App = () => {
	return <Camera color="red" size={48} />;
};

export default App;
```

### Lucide Svelte

[Install Lucide for Svelte](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-svelte)

> TIP: For optimal performance, we recommend importing each icon using the full path.

```svelte
<script>
    import AlertCircle from 'lucide-svelte/icons/alert-circle';
</script>

<AlertCircle color="#ff3e98" />
```

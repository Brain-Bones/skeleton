import { Triangle, Heart, UserRound } from 'lucide-react';

export const components = componentSet;

<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton is <u>icon library agnostic</u>. This means Skeleton supports any combination of SVGs, emoji,
	unicode, or dedicated icon libraries. The choice is yours.</p>

## Lucide

<div class="docs-card-outlined-centered p-8">
	<div class="flex gap-4">
		<Heart size={48} />
		<UserRound size={48} />
		<Triangle size={48} />
	</div>
</div>


For Skeleton's apps and sites, we opt for [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). This provides a huge selection of icons, is avilable to all frameworks, and features a clean and modern style. Our code examples feature Lucide, but if you do not prefer this, simply replace with any alternative.

### Lucide React

[Install Lucide for React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react)

```tsx
import { Camera } from 'lucide-react';

const App = () => {
	return <Camera color="red" size={48} />;
};

export default App;
```

### Lucide Svelte

[Install Lucide for Svelte](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-svelte)

> TIP: For optimal performance, we recommend importing each icon using the full path.

```svelte
<script>
    import AlertCircle from 'lucide-svelte/icons/alert-circle';
</script>

<AlertCircle color="#ff3e98" />
```

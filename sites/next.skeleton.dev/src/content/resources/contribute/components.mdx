## Packages

Framework packages are are found within the Skeleton monorepo as shown below. Each framework packages exports a set of components and related feature, while also being wrapped in an a dedicated app framework. Each app framework acts as sandbox for testing features within that framework's "native" environment alongside the Astro enviroment for the documentation website.

| Package                     | Framework                        | App Framework                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte` | [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/)  | [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) |
| `/packages/skeleton-react`  | [React](https://react.dev/)      | [Vite/React](https://vitejs.dev/)    |


### Dev Server

Run run each app framework, point your terminal at the respective package and run the following command in your terminal.

```
pnpm run dev
```

### Server Ports

Note that you may run both the documentation site and each framework package apps in parallel. The following represents the *default* localhost address and port for each project. This will be displayed in the terminal when starting each dev server.

* Documentation Site: `http://localhost:4321/`
* Svelte Package App: `http://localhost:5173/`
* React Package App: `http://localhost:5173/`

> TIP: Each framework package you run will increment the next port address by 1 (ex: `5174`, `5175`, etc).

## Add Components

Components are housed in the following location per framework:

| Framework | Directory             |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Svelte    | `/src/lib/components` |
| React     | `/src/components`     |

Use the following file path conventions when creating a new component:

```
/components
    /ComponentName
        ComponentName.{svelte|tsx|...}
        types.ts
```

---

## Props

Component style props follow a structured convention for better semantics, which helps avoid naming conflicts.

> TIP: Note that the parent element does not use a prefix. `foo` and `bar` are placeholders for a semantic element names.

```ts
let {
	// Parent Element
	base: '...',
	bg: '...',
	classes: '...',
	// Child Element
	fooBase: '...',
	fooBg: '...',
	fooClasses: '...',
	// Child or Grandchild Element
	barBase: '...',
	barBg: '...',
	barPadding: '...',
	barClasses: '...',
} = $props<ExampleProps>();
```

### Categories

This includes three categories of props per element. These should be implemented in the following order top-to-bottom.

- `base` - houses the base utility classes, which enables faux-headless styling.
    - Replaces: `cBase` class definitions from Skeleton v2.
    - Parent base props are not prefixed, which helps with parity cross-framework
    - Child base props are prefixed: `titleBase`, `panelBase`, `controlBase`.
- `{property}` - individual style props that houses one or more “swappable” utility classes.
    - Naming should follow Tailwind convention, except for single letter descriptors (`padding` instead of `p`).
    - Parent props are not prefixed: `background`, `margin`, `border`.
    - Child props are prefixed: `titleBg`, `controlMargin`, `panelBorder`.
- `classes` - allows you to extend or override with an arbitrary set of classes..
    - Replaces the inconsistent use of `slotX` and `regionX` classes in Skeleton v2.
    - Parent instances are not prefixed: `classes`
    - Child instances are prefixed: `titleClasses`, `controlClasses`, `panelClasses`


### Visual Reference

The following diagram illustrates how props are added to each individual template element, including the order.

![diagram](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/assets/1509726/dd2f9ccf-a971-4599-9546-4587193dccdb)

> TIP: If you have multiple style props (green), keep them sandwiched between base/classes props.

### Direct Implementation

By default, all component props are passed straight to the template to avoid unnecessary boilerplate.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    let {
        base = '...',
        bg = '...',
        padding = '...',
        classes = '...'
    } = $props<ExampleProps>();
</script>

<div class="{base} {bg} {padding} {classes}">...</div>
```

### Dynamic Style Props

In some scenarios, you may need to conditionally update or swap between one or more sets of utilty classes. For this, we will use an “interceptor” pattern as demonstrated below. The `rx` naming convention denotes the value is “reactive”.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    let {
        active: true,
        // ...
        fooActive = '...',
        fooInactive = '...'
        // ...
    } = $props<ExampleProps>();

    // Interceptor
    const rxActive = $state(active ? fooActive : fooInactive);
</script>

<div class="... {rxActive} ...">...</div>
```

> TIP: for React, utilize a `useState()` hook.

---

## Composed Pattern

To keep Skeleton's component syntax familiar cross-framework, we will make use of a composed pattern. The specific implementation will differ per each supported framework.

### React

For React, this is handled via a dot notation syntax.

```tsx
<Accordion>
    <Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Control>(control)</Accordion.Control>
        <Accordion.Panel>(panel)</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

To implement this, first import the `reactCompose` utility into the component file:

```ts
import { reactCompose } from "../../utils/react-compose";
```

Then scaffold your component exports at the bottom of the file:

```ts
export const Accordion = reactCompose(
    AccordionRoot,                 // -> <Accordion>
    {
        Item: AccordionItem,       // -> <Accordion.Item>
        Control: AccordionControl, // -> <Accordion.Control>
        Panel: AccordionPanel      // -> <Accordion.Panel>
    }
);
```

### Svelte 5

This is handled by pairing child components with [Svelte Snippets](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/snippets).

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<AccordionItem>
		{#snippet controlLead()}(lead){/snippet}
		{#snippet control()}(control){/snippet}
		{#snippet panel()}(panel){/snippet}
	</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Using PNPM

Skeleton makes use of [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) and [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to maintain all projects within the Skeleton monorepo.

1. [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your local computer.
2. [Fork the Skeleton monorepo](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) via the option on GitHub.
3. Use Git to clone the forked project to your local machine.
4. Point your terminal at one of the sites or package projects listed below.
5. Run `pnpm i` to install the required depedencies.
6. Run `pnpm dev` to start a local dev server for each project.

### PR Branch Conventions

| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `docs/*`   | When updating the documentation site. |
| `feat/*`   | When implementing a new feature.      |

Keep branch names short and semantic, using dashes to seperate words.

## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) are used to automatically generate the Skeleton changelog for each release. Any contributions made to projects that live within the `/packages` directory must contain a Changeset. Use the following instructions to generate a changeset.

1. Make sure you're within local pull request feature branch.
2. Navigate to the root of the Skeleton monorepo.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
4. Follow the instructions when prompted.
5. Changeset are added to the `/.changeset` directory.

Changesets use semantic version. We recommend the following convention.

| Version | Role                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `major` | Do not use. Reserved for maintainers.        |
| `minor` | For notable changes, such as a new features. |
| `patch` | For small changes, such as a typo.           |

Changeset descriptions will appear verbatim on the [Changelog](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/blob/dev/packages/skeleton/CHANGELOG.md). Keep it short, semantic, and prefix this like branch names.

```mdx
---
'@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte': minor
